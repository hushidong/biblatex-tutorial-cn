\chapter{序}

The \biblatex\ package is a tour de force by its originator (Philip
Lehmann) and its current maintainer(s) (Phil Kime --- who is also
responsible for \package{Biber} --- assisted by others). It is
powerful. But with power comes complexity. The manual is a mine of
information, but sometimes rather overwhelming.

\footnotesize 介绍作者的动机，相比于全面系统的biblatex手册，希望提供一个介绍性的、实用性的文档，重点解释 biblatex 怎么运作，发掘可能的选项和技巧，来帮助一般用户完成相当\textit{标准的}任务。主要面向一般用户而不是样式作者，便于读者获得一些解决常见问题的答案。

My aim here has been to write something that is a bit more than a mere
introduction, but certainly not a systematic manual. That, after all,
\biblatex\ already has. It is supposed to be, above all, practical:
focussed on explaining not how \biblatex\ works, or exploring all its
possible options and wrinkles, but trying to show how ordinary users
can use it to accomplish reasonably `standard' tasks. It is not
intended to replace the manual; indeed, I have assumed that the reader
will have that to hand. It is not intended as an advanced book for
bibliography-style writers. It is aimed at the ordinary user, who is
looking for practical advice about everyday issues. I hope it will be
useful.

It is a pleasure to acknowledge the help of all those, particularly
those who participate in \TeX-StackExchange, who have directly or
indirectly helped in so many ways. I am also grateful to all those who
have commented on this guide's Github project page. I welcome all
comments and suggestions.

At the time of writing, the version of \biblatex\ on my system is 3.7.
